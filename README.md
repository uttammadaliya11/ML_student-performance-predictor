# ML_student-performance-predictor
A machine learning project that predicts student pass/fail outcomes using data from the UCI Student Performance dataset. It analyzes key factors like past failures, study time, age, and absences, and visualizes feature importance using Random Forest classification.
# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on various personal, social, and academic features using the UCI Student Dataset.
